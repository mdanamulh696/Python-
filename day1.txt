1. Arithmetic Operators
Used for mathematical calculations.

Operator	Description	            Example
+	        Addition	            5 + 3 = 8
-	        Subtraction	            10 - 4 = 6
*	        Multiplication	        6 * 2 = 12
/	        Division	            8 / 2 = 4.0 (float result)
%	        Modulus (remainder)	    10 % 3 = 1
**	        Exponent (power)	    2 ** 3 = 8
//	        Floor division	        7 // 2 = 3

2. Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables.

Operator	        Example	    Meaning
=	                x = 5	    Assign
+=	                x += 3	    x = x + 3
-=	                x -= 2	    x = x - 2
*=	                x *= 4	    x = x * 4
/=	                x /= 2	    x = x / 2
%=	                x %= 3	    x = x % 3
**=	                x **= 2	    x = x ** 2
//=	                x //= 3	    x = x // 3

3. Comparison Operators
Used to compare values (result: True or False).

Operator	        Meaning	            Example
==	                Equal to	        5 == 5 → True
!=	                Not equal to	    5 != 3 → True
>	                Greater than	    7 > 2 → True
<	                Less than	        3 < 5 → True
>=	                Greater or equal	5 >= 5 → True
<=	                Less or equal	    4 <= 6 → True

4. Logical Operators
Used to combine conditions.

Operator	    Meaning	                        Example
and	            Both conditions must be true	(5 > 2 and 3 < 6) → True
or	            At least one condition true	    (5 > 10 or 4 > 1) → True
not	            Reverses Boolean value	        not True → False

5. Bitwise Operators
Operate on binary numbers.

Operator	Meaning
&           AND
`	        `
^	        XOR
~	        NOT
<<	        Left shift
>>	        Right shift


6. Membership Operators

Operator	Meaning	                            Example
in	        True if value exists	            "a" in "apple" → True
not in	    True if value does NOT exist	    "x" not in "apple" → True


7. Identity Operators

Operator	Meaning	                                    Example
is	        Checks if variables refer to same object	x is y
is not	    Checks if they are different objects	    x is not y
